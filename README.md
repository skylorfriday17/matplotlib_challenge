# matplotlib_challenge
This repository is for the challenge using Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook where we look at the tumor volumes of mice over a 45 day testing period where the different mice are given different medications. The Matplotlib library is used with Python to analyze and visualize the effects of different medications on the mice over the given time period.

## Sources
In this challenge I referred to past coursework and also relied heavily on the Xpert Learning Assistant AI Tool. The AI gave me a few code snippets here and there to help me when I was stuck, and most of it I did have to edit in order to fit with my specific code. Other than that I just referred to the internet for code formatting.
